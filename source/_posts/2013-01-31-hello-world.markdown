It’s time. I spent the last week having a blast at CodeMash. The awesome thing about these types of conferences is that you are constantly surrounded by a ton of top notch developers — the kind that are passionate about the craft of software development beyond any particular language, platform, or project. It’s a really refreshing experience. 

I’ve never been much of a blogger, but throughout my career as a developer there have been numerous blogs that have I have looked to for information and insight about the craft. I never used to think much about blogging myself. The bloggers that I followed were mostly unquestioned experts in the industry. What could I possibly have to contribute on that level? 

I realize though, that my way of thinking was completely wrong. My blog doesn’t have to be on that level — and there’s a strong chance that it won’t be. It’s time to start contributing back to other developers in any way that I can. If something that I write is useful to just 1 other developer — even if it’s someone that I work with — then I’ve accomplished something. 

Here goes nothing…
